# 開始使用工作流程{#gs-workflows}



## 關於工作流程{#about-workflows}

Adobe Campaign 包括一個工作流程模組，可跨應用程式伺服器的不同模組策劃所有流程和任務。使用這個全方位的圖像式環境，您可以設計各式流程，包含細分、行銷活動執行、檔案處理、人力參與等。工作流程引擎將執行並追蹤這些流程。

例如，您可以使用工作流程從伺服器下載檔案、解壓縮，然後將其中的記錄匯入 Adobe Campaign 資料庫。

此外，工作流程也涉及到要進行通知的一或多個操作者，或者是可以選擇並核准流程的相關人員。如此一來，就可以在開始傳送前建立傳送動作、指派任務給一位或多位操作員來處理內容、指定目標以及核准校樣。

工作流程會在行銷活動管理流程的不同內容和階段中進行。

Adobe Campaign uses workflows to:

* Carry out targeting campaigns. [Learn more](building-a-workflow.md#implementation-steps-)
* Build campaigns: for each campaign, the **[!UICONTROL Workflow]** tab lets you build the target and create the deliveries. [Learn more](building-a-workflow.md#campaign-workflows)
* Perform technical processes: cleanup, collecting tracking information or provisional calculations. [Learn more](building-a-workflow.md#technical-workflows)

A workflow can mean both a process definition (the workflow model, which is a representation of what is supposed to happen) and an instance of this process (a workflow instance, which is a representation of what is actually happening).

The workflow template describes the various tasks to be performed and how they are linked together. The task templates are called activities and are represented by icons. They are linked together by transitions.

Each workflow contains:

* **[!UICONTROL Activities]**

  An activity describes a task template. The various activities available are represented on the diagram by icons. Each type has common properties and specific properties. For example, while all activities have a name and label, only the **[!UICONTROL Approval]** activity has an assignment.

  In a workflow diagram, a given activity can produce multiple tasks, in particular when there is a loop or recurrent (periodic) actions.

  All workflow activities are listed in [this section](about-activities.md), including use cases and samples.

* **[!UICONTROL Transitions]**

  Transitions enable you to link activities and to define their sequence. A transition links a source activity to a destination activity. There are several sorts of transitions, which depend on the source activity. Some transitions have additional parameters such as a duration, a condition or a filter.

  A transition which is not linked to a destination activity is colored orange and the arrow head is shown as a diamond.

  >[!NOTE]

  >A workflow containing unterminated transitions can still be executed: a warning message will be generated and the workflow will pause once it reaches the transition but it will not generate an error. It is thus possible to start a workflow without it being finished and to add to it as you go along.

  For more information about how to build a workflow, refer to [this section](building-a-workflow.md).

* **[!UICONTROL Worktables]**

  The worktable contains all the information carried by the transition. Each workflow uses several worktables. The data conveyed in these tables can be accelerated and used throughout the workflow's life cycle, as long as it is not purged. Indeed, unneeded tables are purged each time the workflow is passivated, and possibly during the execution of the largest workflows to avoid overloading the server.

  Learn more on workflow data and tables in [this section](how-to-use-workflow-data.md).

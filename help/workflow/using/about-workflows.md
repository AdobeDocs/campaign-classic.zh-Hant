# 使用工作流程自動化 {#gs-workflows}

Adobe Campaign的工作流程可讓您的團隊簡化並自動化整個平台的端對端業務流程。 透過直覺式的圖形介面，您可以設計和管理工作流程來協調工作，例如資料細分、行銷活動執行、檔案處理，甚至使用者核准 — 全都集中在一處。

例如，您可以自動執行從遠端伺服器擷取檔案、擷取檔案內容，以及順暢地將資料載入Adobe Campaign伺服器的程式，減少手動工作量，並提升營運效率。 工作流程引擎可確保每個步驟都可靠地執行，並受到追蹤以利可視性和控制。

Adobe Campaign uses workflows to:

* Carry out targeting campaigns. [Learn more](building-a-workflow.md#implementation-steps-)
* Build campaigns: for each campaign, the **[!UICONTROL Workflow]** tab lets you build the target and create the deliveries. [Learn more](building-a-workflow.md#campaign-workflows)
* Perform technical processes: cleanup, collecting tracking information or provisional calculations. [Learn more](building-a-workflow.md#technical-workflows)

A workflow can mean both a process definition (the workflow model, which is a representation of what is supposed to happen) and an instance of this process (a workflow instance, which is a representation of what is actually happening).

The workflow template describes the various tasks to be performed and how they are linked together. The task templates are called activities and are represented by icons. They are linked together by transitions.

![](assets/example1.png)

Each workflow contains:

* **[!UICONTROL Activities]**

  An activity describes a task template. The various activities available are represented on the diagram by icons. Each type has common properties and specific properties. For example, while all activities have a name and label, only the **[!UICONTROL Approval]** activity has an assignment.

  In a workflow diagram, a given activity can produce multiple tasks, in particular when there is a loop or recurrent (periodic) actions.

  All workflow activities are listed in [this section](about-activities.md), including use cases and samples.

* **[!UICONTROL Transitions]**

  Transitions enable you to link activities and to define their sequence. A transition links a source activity to a destination activity. There are several sorts of transitions, which depend on the source activity. Some transitions have additional parameters such as a duration, a condition or a filter.

  A transition which is not linked to a destination activity is colored orange and the arrow head is shown as a diamond.

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >A workflow containing unterminated transitions can still be executed: a warning message will be generated and the workflow will pause once it reaches the transition but it will not generate an error. It is thus possible to start a workflow without it being finished and to add to it as you go along.

  For more information about how to build a workflow, refer to [this section](building-a-workflow.md).

* **[!UICONTROL Worktables]**

  The worktable contains all the information carried by the transition. Each workflow uses several worktables. The data conveyed in these tables can be accelerated and used throughout the workflow's life cycle, as long as it is not purged. Indeed, unneeded tables are purged each time the workflow is passivated, and possibly during the execution of the largest workflows to avoid overloading the server.

  Learn more on workflow data and tables in [this section](how-to-use-workflow-data.md).
